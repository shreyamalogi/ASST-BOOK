//bitwise operators

//AND OPERATOR : 			if both are 1, then only ans is 1
//OR OPERATOR : 			any one of the element shoube 1
//XOR OPERATOR: 			SAME VALUES	will be 0, diff values will be 1
//ones compliment : 		ulta
//left shift operator: 		4<<1 (0100) will give 1000 which is 8 ka decimal...(shift one position towards left)
//right shift operator: 	4>>1 (0100) will give 0010 which is 2 ka decimal....

//a<<n = a multiplied by 2 power n
//a>>n = a divided by 2 power n

////assignment operators
//
//	=		assigns right operand to left operand
//	+=		assigns sum of two operands to the left operand  a+=b means a=a+b
//	-=  	diff
//	*=  	product
//	/=  	quotient 

//miscellaneous operators

//sizeof()  		//returns the size of the variable eg:int a;.....sizeof(a)-->4 cuz integer takes 4 bytes
//condition? x:y  	//returns value of x if condition is true or else value of y
//cast				//convert one data type to another....eg: char ch='a'  int(ch)-->97 (it will cout the ascii value)
//,              	//causes a sequence of operations to be performed
//&					//reference operator	returns address of the variable
//*					//pointer to a variable


//refer precendence and asociativity table
